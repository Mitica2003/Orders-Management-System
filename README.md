# Orders-Management-System

## Introduction

This Java-based application is designed to efficiently handle client orders in a warehouse setting. It enables users to create, manage, and track orders and products seamlessly through an intuitive graphical interface.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this system is to simplify warehouse order processing by offering:

- A graphical user interface with dedicated sections for clients, products, and order management.
- Detailed Javadoc documentation for better code understanding.
- A relational database system for reliable data storage.
- Reflection-based mechanisms for dynamic CRUD operations and table header generation.
- Automatic bill generation for every order using Java records.

## Key Features

- **Intuitive Interface**: Three distinct windows for managing clients, products, and orders.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Code documentation following Javadoc standards.
- **Persistent Storage**: Data is securely stored in a relational database.
- **Dynamic Operations**: Reflection is used to simplify CRUD operations and generate table headers dynamically.
- **Automated Billing**: Each order triggers an automatic bill creation.

## System Architecture

The project follows a structured approach utilizing OOP principles, reflection, and a layered architecture. The core components include:

- **Business Logic Layer (BLL)**: Handles logic related to managing clients, products, and orders.
- **Data Access Object (DAO)**: Implements generic CRUD operations along with specific DAOs for different entities.
- **Validation Module**: Ensures correctness for email formats, prices, stock, and quantity values.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Provides user-friendly forms for seamless interaction.
- **Model Layer**: Defines entities such as clients, products, orders, and bills.

## Insights and Future Scope

This project showcases the efficient application of OOP concepts, making warehouse order management more systematic. It demonstrates the practicality of reflection, structured layering, and detailed documentation. Potential improvements could include expanding database capabilities and integrating more advanced data querying techniques for enhanced functionality.
